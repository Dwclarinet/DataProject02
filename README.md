# Florida Community Colleges Data
In this project, we wanted to find information about 5 selected community colleges in Florida. We found datasets for tuition and graduation rate. We also found data on some general data for each college such as name and address.
In order to access this database, please create a database named 'community_college' then use the included table-schemata.sql file to create your tables.
The Juputer Notebook included will combine the datasets within the data folder.
We have also included a Database Diagram to show how to data flows.
